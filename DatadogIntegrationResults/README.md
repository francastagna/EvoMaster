# Datadog Integration Results

## Overview
This document provides the results of integrating EvoMaster with Datadog for SUT observability and log-driven search enhancement.

## Implementation Components
1. **DatadogIntegration Service**: Implemented to query Datadog API for SUT metrics
2. **DatadogEnhancedSearchAlgorithm**: Uses composition pattern with MIO algorithm
3. **SUT Instrumentation**: Modified ExternalEvoMasterController to include Datadog agent configuration

## API Credential Testing
When testing the Datadog API credentials with the us5 endpoint:

```
curl -X GET "https://us5.datadoghq.com/api/v2/metrics/query?query=system.cpu.idle" \
-H "DD-API-KEY: c6a4485efe6937f2088090b17791a0fc46cff89" \
-H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: f4e87166-0c86-41c0-a3bc-c00f6bcda010"
```

Result: **403 Forbidden** - The API credentials do not have sufficient permissions or are invalid.

## Build Results
The core module with Datadog integration compiled successfully, but there was a dependency resolution error in the e2e-tests-utils module.

## Integration Architecture
The integration creates a feedback loop where:
1. SUT is instrumented with Datadog agent during startup
2. DatadogIntegration periodically queries Datadog API for metrics
3. DatadogEnhancedSearchAlgorithm adjusts search parameters based on metrics:
   - High error rates → increase exploration (startNumberOfMutations, probOfRandomSampling)
   - Slow response times → reduce test complexity (maxTestSize)
   - Low error rates with fast responses → focus on systematic coverage

## Issues and Recommendations
1. **API Authentication**: The provided Datadog API credentials return a 403 Forbidden error. Possible solutions:
   - Verify API key and Application key are correct
   - Check that the keys have appropriate permissions
   - Confirm the service is properly configured in Datadog

2. **Testing Limitations**: Due to API credential issues, full end-to-end testing with actual metrics could not be completed.

## Next Steps
1. Resolve API credential issues
2. Complete end-to-end testing with valid credentials
3. Capture actual metrics and parameter adjustments
